# TLP
The parent directory of the Target-Level Problem (TLP) codebase for solution algorithms and generators of instances

## tlb_exact

The source code of the solution algorithms to solve the TLP. Inside the directory, you will find scripts to build the code, to launch jobs in high-performance computing clusters, and to execute the code on a local machine.

## tlb_generator

A generator of instances for the data of [Datner et al., (2017)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2017.0790). Inside the directory, you will find scripts that build the code and call the executable to generate the instances.

## Codebase for the BRP

The codebase for the BRP can be found in the following [repo](https://github.com/lucasparada20/brp_heur).
