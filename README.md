# TLB
The parent directory of the Target Level Problem (TLB) codebase for solution algorithms and generators of instances

## tlb_exact

The source code of the solution algorithms to solve the TLB. Inside the directory, you will find scripts to build the code, to launch jobs in high-performance computing clusters, and to execute the code on a local machine.

## tlb_generator

A generator of instances for the data of [Datner et al., (2017)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2017.0790). Inside the directory, you will find scripts that build the code and execute the code to generate the instances.

## tlb_generator_slr

A generator of instances for the data of [Technical Report](https://www.cirrelt.ca/documentstravail/cirrelt-2025-02.pdf). Inside the directory, you will find a Makefile to build the code and a script to call the executable and generate the instances.
