# tlb_generator_slr
A generator of instances for large target-level problems in service level requirements.

To build the code, call the Makefile inside the `src` directory. 

## Inputs to the generator

For this generator, you need a `.csv` with historical trips from any bicycle sharing system in this [study](https://www.cirrelt.ca/documentstravail/cirrelt-2025-02.pdf), the `json_station_status` and `json_station_information` files from this [repo](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs).

## Instances

If you are just interested in the generated instances of the study, they are found in this Google [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-0E389K-WTVqK05zVU2rITzFuYCQLoM/view?usp=drive_link)
